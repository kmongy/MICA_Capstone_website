          <h2>Remembering Stories</h2>
          <p>Remembering and retelling oral histories are part of the human experience. It's how
            traditions and culture are passed from generation to generation. Retelling stories reminds the
            community of where one comes from and where one might go, holding together both the
            past and the future.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This is especially true for immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and
            migrants. My parents were refugees, and would chuckle through their stories when they tell me about their
            childhood
            adventures or cry through the sharing of difficult experiences. By retelling their stories, they'd also
            insert a lesson or two about the difficulties and triumphs of life.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As they remember and describe their experiences to me, I try to hold on to every word. Remembering and
            retelling stories—histories—is part and parcel of the immigrant life.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As I was listening again to my mother retell her story, I wondered if I could gain some more insight into
            her life by
            breaking down her story into its atomic parts and then building it back up again—from single words, back to
            sentences, and then into the full story. I also wondered about the words that were used to describe her
            experiences and if it would clue me into something I may have missed before.</p>

            <p>"I was born in Laos in 1962. I have 11 siblings. I'm the fifth oldest child in my family. My two older
              brothers passed away when they were only four and six years old. I also had two sisters after me that
              passed
              away as infants.<br><br>Before my father passed, we lived
              a
              pretty
              comfortable life. He was what was considered a personal bodyguard for General
              Vang Pao. I remember having couches and sleeping on mattresses. I don't think many other people had things
              like this. We
              didn't have to really do anything.<br><br>But my father passed when I was 8 years old. Life changed
              immediately
              after that.
              All the people that helped us before had left. We were left to do things by ourselves. We didn't even know
              how to plant
              or farm well because my mother was married so young. My father was a teacher before he became a soldier.
              He
              was well respected by our community. A lot of people helped our family because of who he was."</p>

          <h2>Remembering Words</h2>
          <p>Oral histories reveal struggles, triumphs, and everything in
            between. The words used to describe these experiences may unearth topics or themes that are important to the
            person telling the oral history.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Including my mother, I wanted to find out what immigrants, refugees,
            and migrants were remembering in their stories. I analyzed a total of 21 oral histories from different
            immigrant and refugee groups. All the words were then separated into single words, amounting to 77,321
            words.</p>
          <br>
          <p>However, not every word needed to be analyzed. So, after accounting for common stop words like "and",
            "but",
            "the",
            and others, the total word count became 20,532 words.</p>
          <br>
          <p>What
            follows are
            the top 100 most frequently mentioned words in all 21 oral histories. The larger and bolder the word, the
            more frequent the word is used</p>

        <h2>Remembering Feelings</h2>
        <p>Positive and negative feelings are captured in the retelling of oral histories.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To get a sense of these feelings, the oral histories were passed through a set of sentiment lexicons.
          The lexicons are based on English words created through various means of crowdsourcing and
          based on what are called 'unigrams'—a single word.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For this section, the oral histories were passed through a lexicon where each word is given a
          rating between -5 and 5 indicating the intensity of a negative or positive sentiment. For example, the word
          "danger" is given an a score of -2, and the word "opportunity" is given a score of 3.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Words from the oral
          histories have to match the words within the lexicon in order to be given an intensity score. I compared May's
          story to three others to see if there were any similarities. Notice
          that the chart
          below does not reach either extreme and goes from -4 to 4.</p>

          the words to display more negative sentiment, but was proven wrong about that hunch.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What I also didn't anticipate was how many times words were used. A good chunk of the oral histories, as
          matched with the lexicon, were used only once. This is revealed by how many light green dots there are on the

        <h2>Remembering Connections</h2>
        <p>Though it is helpful to gauge general sentiment, the sentiment lexicons used above reveal emotions and
          feelings based on single words. For this next portion, I wanted to see how interconnected all 21 oral
          histories were when bound
          together. Were there themes and topics that seem connected across all the stories? Creating an interconnected
          node would help to visualize those connections.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the following chart, you'll notice that there are word-pairs off on their own, while other words have many
          interconnections creating
          little
          worlds that require investigation. The center nodes are words that hold the connection to other words.</p>

            with
            her 7
            children. My older sister was in school, so it was me and other sister, who were preteens who were helping
            with
            everything. We didn't know what to do to get out. My mother was not educated. She didn't even know the
            Laotian
            language.
            At that time, you were supposed to know that language. We just stayed and were scared. It wasn't until much
            later when my older sister came back to find us in order for us to leave."

        <h2>Remembering</h2>
        <p>My mother's story is a large part of mine. It's also become a part of my children's story. This passing down
          of history between generations is how we remember where we come from and where we will go. In each retelling,
          we learn more about each other and more about who we are.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I asked my mother if she thought her story had a more positive or negative narrative arc. She replied that
          she felt her story
          was just her story—neither positive or negative—and that it was true. It was another lesson she imparted to
          me. She reminded me that her story didn't fall neatly into "positive" or "negative" categories. What was
          important to her, and to me, was that the story was shared and told over and over again.</p>

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <p>The data for this project was downloaded from different universities and organizations that have dedicated oral
        history initiatives. I selected and downloaded oral history transcripts from the <a
          href="https://mnhs.gitlab.io/archive/minnesota-immigrant-oral-histories/collections.mnhs.org/ioh/index.html">Minnesota
          Historical Society</a>, the <a href="https://knit.ucsd.edu/rohp/ ">Race and Oral History Project</a>, the <a
          href="https://oralhistory.library.ucla.edu/ ">UCLA
          Library Center for Oral History Research</a>,
        and the <a href="https://www.rfmi.princeton.edu/archive ">Religion and Forced Migration Initiative</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Most of the transcripts were in a PDF format and had to be manually cleaned before analysis. Two transcripts
        were already in a GoogleDoc format which made it much easier to clean. During the
        cleaning process, I removed interviewer and interviewee names, time stamps, and corrected some misspellings. I
        interviewed and transcribed my mother's story. This portion of the project took the longest to complete.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>After completing the cleaning, I analyzed the oral histories using R and
        the <a href="https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/">tidytext</a> package. To compare the stories, I used two
        different sentiment lexicons: The <a href="https://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/pubs/6010-full.html">AFINN</a> and the
        <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">nrc</a>. The AFINN lexicon is the intensity
        lexicon scoring words between -5 and 5. The nrc lexicon was the lexicon that categorized words into different
        emotions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>All but one of the charts were created in R and made interactive with the <a
          href="https://plotly.com/r/">Plotly</a> package. The interactive node chart was made with the <a
          href="https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/">networkD3</a> R
        package. The packed bubble charts were created with RAWGraphs and designed in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
